\section{Recursive Descent -- LL(\(1\)) Grammar}
The grammar given on INGInious needs to be modified in order to not be left-recursive.
The following presents an equivalent grammar which is LL(\(1\)) (its first-sets and follow-sets, as well as the parsing table are given in the code file):
\begin{grammar}
	<E> ::= TE'
	
	<E'> ::= \(\orc\) TE' | \(\epsilon\)
	
	<T> ::= FT'
	
	<T'> ::= \(\andc\) FT' | \(\epsilon\)
	
	<F> ::= \(\notc\) F | (E) | id
\end{grammar}
